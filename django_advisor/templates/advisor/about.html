			<h2> Why is Jamie using RangoAdvisor?</h2>
				<p> Jamie is an Australian backpacker, former CEO that quit his job last week for a year in order to travel the world and refocus on himself as well as reconnecting with mother  nature he missed during his time at his corporate job.

			<h2>Why is Maria using RangoAdvisor?</h2>
				<p>Maria is the daughter of Giorgio Locatelli, a famous London chef. During her early childhood, her father, disguised in order to visit incognito some of the town's restaurants where he was bound to be famous, would regularly teach her how to taste and rate food.  Years after years, her desire to help restaurants grew by providing constructive feedback to help them improve the choice of their ingredients and enhance their presentation. As a professional Michelin Guide reviewer, she would like to increase her audience reach. The platform would be the ideal place for her to do so. She could provide feedback of both quantitative (by rating) and qualitative (by commenting) nature.</p>
